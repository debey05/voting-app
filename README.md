# Voting Application Deployment Project

This project was completed to deploy a **Voting Application** for a vet company.

---

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Code Management & CI
- Developers push the code to the **GitHub repository**.
- **GitHub Actions** is configured to run Continuous Integration (CI) upon each push.
- **SonarQube** checks the code for:
  - Vulnerabilities  
  - Code duplication  
  - Code smells  
- Code must pass defined **quality gates**.  
  - ‚ùå If any check fails ‚Üí CI fails.  
  - ‚úÖ If successful ‚Üí CI continues.  

### 2. Docker Build & Registry
- Once quality checks pass, **Docker images** are built.  
- Images are then pushed to the **Docker Hub repository**.  
- These images are later pulled for Continuous Deployment (CD).

### 3. Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD
- **Argo CD** fetches Kubernetes manifest files from the GitHub repository.  
- It then deploys the images to the **Kubernetes cluster**.  
- Using a **NodePort cluster network**, the deployed application is made accessible to frontend clients via their browser.

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus** scrapes real-time cluster data such as:
  - Node health  
  - Pod status  
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)  
  - Network metrics  
- **Grafana** visualizes this data on dashboards, providing a quick view of cluster performance and health.

Steps to Test
## üß™ Testing the Voting Application

Follow these steps to test that the application is running correctly after deployment:

1. **Verify Pods & Services in Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get svc
Ensure all pods are in Running status.

Check that the NodePort service is exposing the application.

Access the Application in Browser

Open a browser and go to: http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
Replace <NodeIP> with your cluster node‚Äôs external/public IP.

Replace <NodePort> with the port shown in kubectl get svc.

Test Frontend Functionality

Verify the homepage loads.

Cast a vote and confirm it is submitted.

Refresh the page and check if vote counts update correctly.

Check Logs

kubectl logs <pod-name>



Ensure there are no critical errors in the application logs.

Validate Database Connection (if applicable)

Confirm that submitted votes are stored in the backend database.

Check logs or query the database directly to ensure persistence.

Monitor in Grafana

Log in to Grafana Dashboard.

Confirm real-time metrics (CPU, memory, pod health) are visible for the application.

deal with them in Docker at a basic level.
